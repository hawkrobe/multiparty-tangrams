In the end, the some listeners were moaning at me for not being quick, though others were nice about it.\n\nI thought it was interesting that once I started giving the images nicknames, it got quicker.  However, people didn't always get the references.  Ones that worked well were ""Yoda"", ""Ice-skating to the left"", ""dancing opposite you (which became ""legs crossed watching tv"".  The other that worked well went from ""pensive person"" to ""on the floor looking at your phone"".  I thought it quite telling that the one the thing everyone could relate to was poses which made us think of technology.  I thought it was quite sad in a way.","Yes, we could have done it with 2 mins each time"
