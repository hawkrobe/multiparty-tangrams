  abstract = {In current approaches to pragmatic reasoning the comprehension and production of referring expressions is modeled as a result of the interlocutors' mutual perspective-taking under the additional assumption that speakers try to minimize their articulatory effort or production cost. The latter assumption is usually not tested and instead built into the experimental tasks of referential language games by artificially restricting the set of possible referring expressions available to identify a referent. We present two language game experiments: a production experiment, in which the speakers were allowed to freely choose a referring expression, and a comprehension experiment to replicate earlier findings with our stimuli. Our results show that while listeners easily perform pragmatic reasoning, speakers resort to overspecification when the effort of pragmatic reasoning becomes too high.},

But communicating to a large audience can be difficult if audience members have differing preconceptions and hence construe the same message differently. Following this analogy of teaching as communication, we develop a framework for modeling classroom education as optimal communication to a variable audience. We study simple teaching games where teachers provide examples of a target concept to groups of students. Students synthesize these examples with their prior knowledge in order to induce the concept. We consider strategies for managing variability, including ability grouping ("tracking"), reductions in class size, and formative assessment. With known costs on actions, our model can also be extended for decision-theoretic analysis. This model provides a framework for estimating theoretical limits on the utility of educational interventions.},

  abstract = {Dialog is a joint action at different levels. At the highest level, the goal of interlocutors is to align their mental representations. This emerges from joint activity at lower levels, both concerned with linguistic decisions (e.g., choice of words) and nonlinguistic processes (e.g., alignment of posture or speech rate). Because of the high-level goal, the interlocutors are particularly concerned with close coupling at these lower levels. As we illustrate with examples, this means that imitation and entrainment are particularly pronounced during interactive communication. We then argue that the mechanisms underlying such processes involve covert imitation of interlocutors' communicative behavior, leading to emulation of their expected behavior. In other words, communication provides a very good example of predictive emulation, in a way that leads to successful joint activity.},

Here we draw upon recent advances in natural language processing to provide a finer-grained characterization of the dynamics of this learning process. We release an open corpus ({$>$}15,000 utterances) of extended dyadic interactions in a classic repeated reference game task where pairs of participants had to coordinate on how to refer to initially difficult-to-describe tangram stimuli. We find that different pairs discover a wide variety of idiosyncratic but efficient and stable solutions to the problem of reference. Furthermore, these conventions are shaped by the communicative context: words that are more discriminative in the initial context (i.e. that are used for one target more than others) are more likely to persist through the final repetition. Finally, we find systematic structure in how a speaker's referring expressions become more efficient over time: syntactic units drop out in clusters following positive feedback from the listener, eventually leaving short labels containing open-class parts of speech. These findings provide a higher resolution look at the quantitative dynamics of ad hoc convention formation and support further development of computational models of learning in communication.},

At the same time, much of our language use is partner-specific: we know that words may be understood differently by different people based on our shared history. This poses a challenge for accounts of convention formation. Exactly how do agents make the inferential leap to community-wide expectations while maintaining partner-specific knowledge? We propose a hierarchical Bayesian model to explain how speakers and listeners solve this inductive problem. To evaluate our model's predictions, we conducted an experiment where participants played an extended natural-language communication game with different partners in a small community. We examine several measures of generalization and find key signatures of both partner-specificity and community convergence that distinguish our model from alternatives. These results suggest that partner-specificity is not only compatible with the formation of community-wide conventions, but may facilitate it when coupled with a powerful inductive mechanism.},

  abstract = {In a classic paper, Brennan and Clark argued that when interlocutors agree on a name for an object, they are forming a temporary agreement on how to conceptualize that object; that is, they are forming a conceptual pact. The literature on conceptual pacts has largely focused on the costs and benefits of breaking and maintaining lexical precedents, and the degree to which they might be partner-specific. The research presented here focuses on a question about conceptual pacts that has been largely neglected in the literature: To what extent are conceptual pacts specific to the local context of the interaction? If conceptual pacts are indeed temporary, then when the local context changes in ways that are accessible to participants, we would expect participants to seamlessly shift to referential expressions that reflect novel conceptualizations. Two experiments examined how referential forms change across context in collaborative, task-oriented dialog between na\"ive participants. In Experiment 1, names for parts of an unknown object were established in an ``item'' identification stage (e.g., a shape that looked like a wrench was called ``the wrench''). In a second ``build'' stage, that name was often supplanted by an object-oriented name, e.g., the ``leg.'' These changes happened abruptly and without negotiation. In Experiment 2, interlocutors manipulated clip art and more abstract tangram pictures in a ``slider'' puzzle to arrange the objects into a target configuration. On some trials moving an object revealed a picture that could be construed as a contrast competitor, e.g., a clip art picture of a camel after ``the camel'' had been negotiated as a name for a tangram shape, or vice versa. As would be expected, modification rates increased when a potential contrast was revealed. More strikingly, the degree to which a name had been negotiated or the frequency with which it had been used did not affect the likelihood that the revealed shape would be considered as a potential contrast. We find little evidence that names that are introduced as part of a conceptual pact persist when either the task goals or informational needs change. Rather, conceptual pacts are fluid temporary agreements.},

  abstract = {When two people in conversation refer repeatedly to objects, they typically converge on the same (or similar) referring expressions. The repeated use of expressions by people in the same conversation has been called lexical entrainment. Lexical entrainment may emerge from the precedent of associating objects with expressions (and the perspectives they encode), or else from achieving conceptual pacts, or temporary, flexible agreements to view an object in a particular way (in which case the precedent is encoded as specific to a particular partner). We had people interact with a confederate speaker, entraining on shared perspectives (e.g., ``the shiny cylinder'') during repeated references to objects. Then either the original speaker or a new speaker used either the original expression or a new one (``the silver pipe'') to refer to the previously discussed object. Upon hearing the original expressions, addressees looked at and then touched the target objects equally quickly regardless of speaker. However, with new expressions, there was partner-specific interference: addressees were slower to look at the object when the new expression was uttered by the original speaker than when the new expression was uttered by the new speaker. This suggests that the representations in memory from which entrainment emerges do encode a partner-specific cue, leading addressees to expect that a speaker should continue to use an entrained-upon expression unless a contrast in meaning is implicated. There appears to be no such interference when a new partner uses a new expression.},

As a result, these accounts may only offer limited theories of the mechanisms that underlie language processing in general. We propose a mechanistic account of dialogue, the interactive alignment account, and use it to derive a number of predictions about basic language processes. The account assumes that, in dialogue, the linguistic representations employed by the interlocutors become aligned at many levels, as a result of a largely automatic process. This process greatly simplifies production and comprehension in dialogue. After considering the evidence for the interactive alignment model, we concentrate on three aspects of processing that follow from it. It makes use of a simple interactive inference mechanism, enables the development of local dialogue routines that greatly simplify language processing, and explains the origins of self-monitoring in production. We consider the need for a grammatical framework that is designed to deal with language in dialogue rather than monologue, and discuss a range of implications of the account.},

When B had been a silent side participant in the fast conversation, directors continued to use short references when they changed partners. References became less efftcient when B had not been a participant-even when B had heard the first conversation and seen the figures. When B had only heard the fast conversation, he or she was treated much the same as a completely naive partner.

In conversation, speakers collaborate with their partners in making references. In an earlier paper (Clark BL Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986), we proposed that when a speaker wants to refer to an object, it is not enough for her to utter a noun phrase such as the Allen wrench. She and her partner are also responsible for establishing that he has understood her as intended. What they do, therefore, is try to reach the mutual belief that he has understood her reference well enough for current purposes. They collaborate to reach this belief; she looks for reliable evidence of his understanding and he tries to provide it. In the process, he may offer alternative phrasing and ask for repeats or repairs (you mean the small metal thing shaped like an L?); she may offer more information and ask for confirmation.

Extensive research on 2-party conversation has offered key insights into this process, in particular, its partner-specificity: Common ground that is shared with 1 partner is not always assumed to be shared with other partners. Conversation often involves multiple pairs of individuals who differ in common ground. Yet, little is known about common ground processes in multi-party conversation. Here, we take a 1st step toward understanding this problem by examining situations in which simple dyadic representations of common ground might cause difficulty\textemdash situations in which dialogue partners develop shared labels (entrained terms), and then a 3rd (na\"ive) party joins the conversation. Experiment 1 examined unscripted, task-based conversation in which 2 partners entrained on terms. At test, speakers referenced game-pieces in a dialogue with their partner, or in a 3-party conversation including a new, na\"ive listener. Speakers were sensitive to the 3rd party, using longer, disfluent expressions when additionally addressing the new partner. By contrast, analysis of listener eye-fixations did not suggest sensitivity. Experiment 2 provided a stronger test of sensitivity and revealed that listeners do cancel expectations for terms that had been entrained before when a 3rd, na\"ive party joins the conversation. These findings shed light on the mechanisms underlying common ground, showing that rather than a unitary construct, common ground is flexibly adapted to the needs of a na\"ive 3rd party.},

Here, we test the hypothesis that speakers will depart from an Aim Low approach in order to efficiently communicate with larger groups of interacting partners. Further, we ask whether the cognitive demands of tracking multiple conversational partners' perspectives places limitations on successful audience design. We find that speakers can successfully track information about what up to four of their partners do and do not know in conversation. When addressing groups of 3\textendash 4 addressees at once, speakers design language based on the combined knowledge of the group. These findings point to an audience design process that simultaneously represents the perspectives of multiple other individuals and combines these representations in order to design utterances that strike a balance between the different needs of the individuals within the group.},

Despite the ubiquity of multiparty conversation in everyday life, little is known about the processes by which speakers design language in multiparty conversation. While prior evidence demonstrates that speakers design utterances to accommodate addressee knowledge in multiparty conversation, it is unknown if and how speakers encode and combine different types of perspective information. Here we test whether speakers encode the perspective of multiple addressees, and then simultaneously consider their knowledge and physical context during referential design in a three-party conversation. Analyses of referential form\textemdash expression length, disfluency, and elaboration rate\textemdash in an interactive multiparty conversation demonstrate that speakers do take into consideration both addressee knowledge and physical context when designing utterances, consistent with a knowledge-scene integration view. These findings point to an audience design process that takes as input multiple types of representations about the perspectives of multiple addressees, and that bases the informational content of the to-be-designed utterance on a combination of the perspectives of the intended addressees.},
